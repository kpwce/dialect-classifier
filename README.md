# Dialect Classifier

## Introduction
>One of the beauty of the Spanish language is the many ways it is spoken.

A question I had is to what extent a simple Java program can distinguish these dialects, especially only given some texts. It's hard to classify dialects in the first place. Some relevant questions that I asked myself before beginning to write the code were:

* How different does a dialect have to be to become another dialect?

* How much would using solely texts and no verbal input influence results?

* What kinds of texts will give us the best results, in terms of "summing up" the dialect without too many words?

* How should Spanish gendered words and tildes be handled?

This project is a preliminary response to the above questions.

Note: I have included some sample text files, including texts displaying to various extents the Mexican, Castillian, Rioplatense and Carribean dialects.
